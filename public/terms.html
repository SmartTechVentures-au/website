          <h2>THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE FOR SERVICES</h2>
          <p>(“Terms of Sale”) apply to your purchase of services performed by Smart Tech or its subcontractors and/or
            agents (collectively, "Services"). By engaging Smart Tech to perform Services under a Statement of Work (as
            defined below), you agree to be bound by and accept these Terms of Sale, unless you are purchasing such
            Services pursuant to a separate written agreement signed by both your company and Smart Tech, in which case
            the terms of that separate agreement will govern. Smart Tech may, from time to time and at its sole option,
            revise these Terms of Sale without notice by posting them on its website at smarttechventures.au (the
            “Website”). The Terms of Sale posted on the Website at the time Smart Tech accepts your order govern that
            purchase.</p>

          <h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
          <p>The description of the scope of work and terms associated with the Services ("Statement of Work" or “SOW”),
            along with these Terms of Sale - Services and any attachments, schedules, addenda, and exhibits, together
            form the entire agreement between the parties regarding the Services to be performed by Smart Tech (the
            “Agreement”). The Agreement supersedes any prior representations or agreements, oral or written, and all
            other communications between the parties relating to the relevant subject matter. Any conflicting,
            additional, or different terms in any other agreement, invoice, or SOW are expressly rejected, unless the
            modified Terms of Sale are specifically referenced and mutually agreed upon in writing under the SOW. Such
            modification will apply exclusively to that SOW.</p>

          <h3>Competition and Consumer Act (CCA)</h3>
          <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, these Terms of Sale must be read and construed subject to any statutory
            provisions which cannot lawfully be excluded, restricted, or modified. If any such statutory provisions
            apply, then, to the extent that Smart Tech is entitled to do so and at Smart Tech's option, Smart Tech
            limits its liability under such provisions to the re-performance or refund of the cost of Services.</p>

          <h3>Term; Termination</h3>
          <p>The Agreement commences upon execution of the relevant SOW (“Effective Date”), which incorporates these
            Terms of Sale, and will continue until completion of the Services, unless terminated earlier in accordance
            with this Section. Either party may terminate the Agreement, in whole or in part, immediately if the other
            party materially breaches the Agreement and fails to remedy that breach within 30 days after receipt of
            written notice of such breach, except that a party will have only 10 days to remedy any default of its
            payment obligations.</p>

          <h3>Invoicing/Payment</h3>
          <p>Services will be invoiced in accordance with the SOW. Services will be deemed accepted (completed) 5 days
            from the date of the invoice, unless otherwise specified in writing under the SOW. You must pay all
            undisputed invoices in full within 30 days of the invoice date, unless otherwise specified under the SOW.
            You agree to pay the total purchase price for the Services, plus taxes (including any GST payable), and all
            payments must reference the invoice number. You may provide Smart Tech with a tax exemption certificate at
            the time of purchase, subject to review and acceptance by Smart Tech. Unless otherwise specified, all
            invoices shall be paid in the currency specified on the invoice. If invoices are paid in a different
            currency, you agree to remit payment to Smart Tech for any losses incurred due to conversion resulting in a
            short-payment of such invoices.</p>

          <h3>Credit/Late Payment</h3>
          <p>Your order is subject to acceptance and credit approval by Smart Tech. You must provide appropriate credit
            references upon request and authorize Smart Tech to obtain credit history from such references. You agree to
            pay interest on all past-due amounts at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month (18% per
            annum), or such lesser amount determined by Smart Tech, calculated monthly on the past-due amount. You will
            be responsible for Smart Tech's costs of collection for any payment default, including, but not limited to,
            court costs, filing fees, and attorneys' fees. Additionally, if payments are not received as described
            above, Smart Tech reserves the right to suspend performance of Services until payment is received.</p>

          <h3>Limited Services Warranty</h3>
          <p><strong>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AND SUBJECT TO THE CCA CLAUSE:</strong><br>
            Smart Tech warrants that Services will: (i) be performed in a timely, competent, professional, and
            workmanlike manner; (ii) substantially conform to the written specifications under the SOW for 30 days from
            completion, or for such other warranty period as indicated under the relevant SOW; and (iii) comply with all
            laws, rules, and regulations applicable to Smart Tech's performance of the Services under the SOW.
            Notwithstanding the foregoing, Smart Tech is not responsible for defaults or delays caused by your failure
            to provide accurate instructions, information, access to facilities, or a suitable product or application
            environment.</p>

          <p>Your sole remedy and Smart Tech's sole obligation for breach of this Limited Services Warranty, except as
            set forth in any SOW that expressly amends this warranty, will be the re-performance of any deficient
            Services at Smart Tech's expense. If Smart Tech cannot remedy any deficient Services within 30 days of
            notice or such additional time as may be mutually agreed, Smart Tech will, at its option, provide a credit
            or refund of any fees paid for the specific non-conforming Services. No re-performance will extend any
            warranty period. Any credits issued to you by Smart Tech for any reason must be applied within 2 years from
            the date the credit is issued. If not used within such period, credits will automatically expire.</p>

          <h3>Warranty Disclaimer</h3>
          <p><strong>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AND SUBJECT TO THE CCA CLAUSE, THE LIMITED WARRANTIES UNDER
              SECTION 4 ARE IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE
              REMEDIES.</strong> Smart Tech DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
            SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO
            THE PERFORMANCE OR NON-PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES. TO THE EXTENT AN IMPLIED WARRANTY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, SUCH
            WARRANTY IS LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE WARRANTY PERIOD.</p>

          <h3>Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
          <p>Smart Tech retains all rights, title, and interest in any pre-existing intellectual property that it owns
            ("Smart Tech IP"), which may be used in carrying out Services, including any modifications or improvements
            made to Smart Tech IP during or as a result of the Services to be performed under the Agreement. Except for
            Smart Tech IP, upon payment in full of all amounts due to Smart Tech, all documents, drawings,
            specifications, information, patents, patent applications, inventions, developments, processes, or any
            copyrightable material originated and developed by Smart Tech specifically for you as part of the Services
            performed under the Agreement ("Work Product") shall be owned by you. Smart Tech grants you a worldwide,
            non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual license, without the right to sublicense, to use Smart Tech IP in the
            course of your internal business operations.</p>
